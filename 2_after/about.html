  	<h1>About Us</h1>

  	<p>Established in 1998, NUS School of Computing provides a stimulating environment that amalgamates the best of educational traditions, drawing its faculty staff of 200 from leading universities ranging from the Ivy League to Oxbridge.
  	</p>
  	<p>The School, which is a fully fledged faculty within the National University of Singapore, has about 2,000 students, a quarter of them pursuing graduate studies. Since its early days as the only university department in Singapore that produced computing talent for the workforce, NUS School of Computing has produced a trail of distinguished alumni, including the chief executives and technology architects of multinationals and government agencies.
  	</p>
  	<p>The School encourages excellence in diversity among its students. Some are winners of prestigious awards such as the National Infocomm Scholarship. Others are creative thinkers capable of besting their peers in international competitions in areas such as Games Artificial Intelligence.
  	</p>
  	<p>At the School, research initiatives are supported by a number of research laboratories and centres. Fitted with equipment that is funded mainly by research grants, the laboratories and centres provide a common space for people with similar interest to exchange ideas and work together.
  	</p>
  	<p>The School is managed by an Executive Committee, with input from an Industry Advisory Committee.
  	</p>
  	<p>In terms of affiliation, the School enjoys a close working relationship with its alumni, represented by the Computer and Information Science Alumni Association (CISAA). The student body is represented by the NUS Students' Computing Club, whose precursor was the Computer Science Society.
  	</p>
  	<p>Historically, NUS School of Computing traces its roots to the Department of Information Systems and Computer Science (DISCS) within the Faculty of Science, and further to the joint campus days.
